The time between adb signal to actual android snap is about 1.0~1.1 seconds.

The capture() function returns almost as the same time the image is taken.

Using this test, I found out that it takes at least 0.8 seconds for the phone
to write the image into storage. (i.e. t=0.7 failed)

t = 2
while x is not None:
  android.capture()
  time.sleep(t)
  x = android.fetchImage()
  t = t - 0.1

Therefore, the optimal way to get a synced image without going into
multithreading is as such:


from util import android, kinect
import time

kinect.getDepth() # to "warm up" the kinect

android.capture()
depth = kinect.getDepth()
time.sleep(1)
img = android.fetchImage()
